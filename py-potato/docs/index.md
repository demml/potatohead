Potato Head is considered a core/utility crate to both [opsml](https://github.com/demml/opsml) and [scouter](https://github.com/demml/scouter), providing essential rust and python components for building agentic workflows. At the current moment, only crates are published, which are then used in both opsml and scouter to provide user-friendly interfaces. The documentation contained in this repository is meant to help you understand the core concepts of potatohead and how to use it within `Opsml` and `Scouter`.
