Build an Agentic Potato Head. Add a **mouth** (chat), **eyes** (vision/image) and even **ears** (audio)! Fun for all ages!

**Note:** Potato Head currently supports OpenAI compatible apis (more coming soon!) and you can only use **Mouths**. We are actively working on adding more parts to the Potato Head!

Potato Head is considered a core/utility crate to both [opsml](https://github.com/demml/opsml) and [scouter](https://github.com/demml/scouter), providing essential rust and python components for building agentic workflows. At the current moment, only crates are published, which are then used in both opsml and scouter to provide user-friendly interfaces. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.demml.io/) for more information on how to use Potato Head in your projects.
